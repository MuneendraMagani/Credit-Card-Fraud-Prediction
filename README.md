# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction
## Abstract
The main aim of our project is to predict the fraud transactions using machine learning techniques, to find out whether the transaction is fraud or not so that we can reduce the percentage of fraud transactions to protect the cardholders and also not to affect the reputation of the bank. We took a dataset from Machine Learning Group at ULB from Kaggle which is titled as credit card fraud prediction. We reformulated the issue of predicting fraud transactions as a binary classification challenge and explored using ensemble approaches, anomaly detection techniques, and classification algorithms. The data is imbalanced to balance the data we implemented SMOTE. In this project, we go further and experiment on random forest with SMOTE, SMOTE with XGBoost and SMOTE with isolation forest . Based on the results, we discovered that XGBoost with SMOTE seemed to perform almost the same as the Random Forest on the dataset.
